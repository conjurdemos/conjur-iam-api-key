## Pull Request Workflow

1. Search the [open issues](../../issues) in GitHub to find out what has been planned
2. Select an existing issue or open an issue to propose changes or fixes
3. Add any relevant labels as you work on it
4. Submit a pull request, linking the issue in the description
5. Adjust labels as-needed on the issue. Ask another contributor to review and merge your code if there are delays in merging.
